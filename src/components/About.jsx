            My name is Mariya Baig. I am a Software Engineer from Indore.

            I also go by Full Stack Developer, Front-End Developer, or Back-End Developer.<br/>
            I'm currently working using MERN stack. My goal is to build highly performant applications that solve real-world problems and provide users with an awesome experience.

            
            <br/>
            
            With all that said, I don’t like to just define myself by the work I’ve done. My inspiration is boundless, it fuels me in the pursuit of cultivating new skills. My ability to juggle different projects and roles with relative ease is the key to my success.

Over the course of my life and career I have developed expertise in several areas of web development and design. I am seeking to continue this growth by opening myself for opportunities which are guaranteed to challenge me.

You can review my latest work in my Portfolio and read more about my biography, experience, skills, education and much more in my Resume.
